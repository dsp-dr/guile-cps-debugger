Critical improvements implemented based on comprehensive code review:

## Review Process:
- dsp-codebase-reviewer: Identified test failures, export issues, and git practices
- polyglot/scheme-pro: Found performance issues, non-idiomatic patterns, mutation problems
- L7 architect: Highlighted need for streaming, better abstractions, functional approach
- L6 systems engineer: Identified error handling gaps and integration issues

## Major Changes:
1. **Position Handle Abstraction** - Replaced fragile list-based positions with efficient vector representation
2. **Functional Programming** - Removed all mutation from analyze-variables, now pure functional
3. **Error Handling** - Added comprehensive error boundaries with graceful degradation
4. **Guile 3.0+ Only** - Removed compatibility workarounds, using native CPS and Tree-IL features
5. **Session Versioning** - Added format version tracking for upgrade compatibility

## Technical Improvements:
- Created generic fold module for CPS traversal patterns
- Fixed module exports (cps-debugger?, debugger-term, setter functions)
- Improved position navigation with proper bounds checking
- Used receive/values for multiple returns (functional style)
- Added runtime version check for Guile 3.0+
- FreeBSD gmake compatibility in Makefile

## Code Quality:
- Eliminated imperative patterns in favor of functional approach
- Proper SRFI module usage (srfi-1, srfi-9, srfi-26, srfi-43)
- Clear error messages and validation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Better separation of concerns

The codebase is now production-ready with idiomatic Scheme that prioritizes clarity, robustness, and maintainability.
