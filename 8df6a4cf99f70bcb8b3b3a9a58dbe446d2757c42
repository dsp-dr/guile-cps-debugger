Diagram organization and visualization context:

## Original Generation:
The diagrams in visualizer-output.mmd were generated from test scripts:
- test-visualizer.scm: Test script for the visualizer module
- examples/visualizer-examples.scm: Contains diagram generation functions

## Migration Process:
1. Split monolithic visualizer-output.mmd into individual diagram files
2. Created diagrams/ directory for better organization
3. Each algorithm now has its own .mmd file
4. Added README.md with viewing instructions

## Files Created:
- diagrams/fibonacci-cps-flow.mmd - Fibonacci sequence CPS transformation
- diagrams/gcd-cps-flow.mmd - Greatest Common Divisor with tail recursion
- diagrams/product-list-cps-flow.mmd - List processing with continuations
- diagrams/ackermann-cps-flow.mmd - Complex Ackermann function (A(2,1))
- diagrams/tree-sum-cps-flow.mmd - Binary tree traversal in CPS
- diagrams/README.md - Documentation and viewing instructions

## Cleanup Status:
✓ Removed visualizer-output.mmd (replaced by individual diagrams)
✓ test-visualizer.scm - Kept as it's the generation script
✓ examples/visualizer-examples.scm - Kept as it contains generation functions

## Future Work:
- Consider updating test-visualizer.scm to output directly to diagrams/
- Add generation timestamps to diagram files
- Create automated diagram generation from CPS terms

## Technical Note:
These diagrams visualize the continuation-passing style transformation,
showing how functions build up continuations during recursion and apply
them during the return phase. Color coding indicates:
- Green: Base cases
- Purple: Recursive calls
- Yellow: Continuation applications

The diagrams help developers understand CPS flow and debug transformations.
